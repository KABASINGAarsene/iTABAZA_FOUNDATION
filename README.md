**Itabaza**: Solution to Rwandan Health Care System

In Rwanda, long waiting lines, delays, and injustice are often the big problem of the way people have to travel to obtain quality healthcare services. Clients have to wake up at early hours just to undergo endless queues in hospitals only to be referred to the nether side of possibility which includes rejection or being neglected. A lack of a credible appointment mechanism means that most Rwandans have to resort to chance or personal relations as a method of getting necessary attention promptly, a disparity that is unfair in addition to being time-wasting and health-threatening. Such a discouraging truth discourages a lot of people to receive care at an early stage, which sometimes entails unnecessary complications. Besides that, the lack of elaborate feedback system compels healthcare providers to lack realisation of areas critical in service gap, hence hindering their effectiveness to perform.

Meet Itabaza- an innovative, locally-grown digital platform designed by a special team of committed Rwandan scientists to change access to health care through equal, transparent, and efficient services. Itabaza makes it easy on patients to make medical appointments online, enabling in-person visits, as well as video visits, so patients can cut the time, eliminate overcrowding, and have flexible access to care. In addition to booking an appointment, Itabaza can provide patients with necessary medical documents in the digital version and can leave feedback about their experience and make it their voices that will be used to engage in constant improvement. Stressing on equal access and accountability, Itabaza is not just a tool, it is a movement towards the healthcare system where every person knows their rights and the quality of healthcare services will be timely and reliable to all Rwandans.

The future of Rwanda in terms of healthcare with Itabaza is the future in which a healthcare institution will be unwilling to leave a patient alone because of prolonged waits or favoritism, one in which technology will actually help to fill a gap instead of creating one and one in which the experience of the patient is empowered by trust, respect, and transparency. One appointment at a time we can make Rwanda a healthier place.

**1.1 Problem Statement** 

Despite technological advances achieved in Rwanda, the ***healthcare booking system in Rwanda remains heavily manual and disorganized*** in most hospitals. Patients often travel long distances only to wait for hours, sometimes without even seeing a doctor that day. The underlying problems include: 

**I.Long Waiting Times in Hospitals** 

Patients can spend hours , sometimes even days waiting for a consultation due to a lack of appointment structure,

**III. Lack of Transparency in Doctor Availability** 

Patients cannot know in advance which doctors are available, when, or where. This leads to **blind visits**, where patients gamble on whether they will receive care. 

These issues affect both **patient health** and **hospital productivity**, and in emergency situations, they can be fatal. 

**1.2 Objectives** 

iTABAZA was born out of a vision to make healthcare delivery faster, more efficient, and more patient-centered. Its core objectives are: 

**I. Reduce Patient Wait Times** 

By allowing patients to book appointments digitally, where they can meet doctor virtually, and access services based on real-time doctor availability, iTABAZA reduces unnecessary hospital visits and overcrowding effectively. 

**II. Improve Patient-Doctor Communication**

Integrated video call, and document sharing features allow patients to communicate with healthcare providers from their homes, improving trust and continuity of care. 

**Scope** 

iTABAZA is designed to be inclusive, scalable, and sensitive to Rwanda’s unique context. Here’s what the platform covers: 

 **Accessible via web app**

Currently it is accessible via th web app“[https://itabaza-2qjt.vercel.app/](https://itabaza-2qjt.vercel.app/)”.  Recognizing that not everyone owns a smartphone, the platform is also accessible via USSD which is considered for futur development , making it available to people in rural areas or with feature phones. This multi-accessibility model ensures inclusivity for all citizens. 

**1.4 Target Audience** 

iTABAZA has been designed to serve a broad range of stakeholders. This document is also written with each of them in mind: 

***1\. Patients*** 

Patients are the primary beneficiaries. They will use the platform to: 

 	       ● Book appointments, 

● easy to book virtual call (allowing patient unable to meet doctor to book visit doctor virtually) 

● View medical records, 

● sharing of document (doctor can upload document to be visible to patient dashboard via of prescription , exam lab or any other document) . 

***2\. Doctors*** 

Doctors will benefit from: 

● easy to upload document features to patient view, 

● Access to patient history (submmitted by patient while booking appointment),  

* Doctor can meet doctor via call not alwys to meet in person , which means even in his/her holidays can still meet patient where she or he is   
  ***3\. Hospital Administrators*** 

Admins will: 

● Create and manage doctor accounts, 

● Configure service availability, 

● Monitor patient support request.

**Conclusion: A New Era in Healthcare Access** 

iTABAZA is not just a digital tool . It's a bridge between **technology and social impact.** It aligns with Rwanda’s digital transformation agenda and aims to modernize healthcare delivery in a sustainable and inclusive way. This introductory chapter laid the foundation for understanding the “***why***” and “***who***” of the project. 

**SYSTEM OVERVIEW** 

***iTABAZA** : Revolutionizing Healthcare Access in Rwanda* 

<img width="1355" height="619" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82919c45-141f-4e9f-b112-856bc9d574e6" />

As Rwanda modernizes its healthcare infrastructure, it is crucial that technological interventions are designed to match the real needs of hospitals, doctors, patients, and policymakers. ***iTABAZA*** is not just another app; it is a thoughtfully engineered solution to Rwanda’s systemic healthcare bottlenecks. 

This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the system what it does, how it works, who uses it, and how inclusivity is embedded in its core design. 

**Core Features** 

iTABAZA is built around a modular system of interconnected features. These modules are designed to function independently but work together to provide a seamless user experience. 

**VI. Video Call Consultations** 

● With this feature, patients can: 

● Book a remote consultation 

● Share screen on call

* Admin also recieves all the support ticket from all the users , in case they are encountering any issue with using the platform 

**2.2 How It Works** 

Let’s walk through how different users interact with the platform: **Patient Journey** 

1\. **Registration**: Patient signs up with name, phone number, email 

<img width="1360" height="621" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deaef307-0a5c-4dc9-9feb-ac19d34d2338" />

2\. **Search & Book**: patient can book appintment with any doctor as listed in on the platform 

<img width="1366" height="613" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/690a1a3d-c861-4037-8041-913c9a841cbf" />

     3\. **Consultation**: The patient visits physically or joins via video call

<img width="1355" height="624" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a745994a-7a99-49b5-b888-9b9835d88980" />

**Doctor Workflow** 

1\. **Login**: Doctor accesses dashboard showing today’s appointments. 

2\. **Consult Patients**: In-person or through video. Can see all of the patient submission like problem discription as record or written prescription.

3\. Doctor can submit support ticket , and this support ticket in case he/she is encountering issue with appointment booked or any other thing inconvenient to him/her under his/her dashboard

<img width="1363" height="626" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9480b2e5-aa60-4dea-8117-b6e04a299078" />

4\. After appointment doctor can upload document to patient

      4\. **Support request**: Receive all support request from users of this platform both patient and doctor

**2.3 User Roles & Privileges** 

The platform recognizes and separates user privileges clearly. 

| User Type  | Key Functions |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Patients**  | Book appointments, join video calls, access medical records and send support ticket |
| **Doctors**  | view patient history and description before meeting patient , can meet videocall with patient in case doctor is not in holidays , can send support ticket. |
| **Admins**  | Create doctor accounts, can monitor all the activities/traffic under the platform.  |

**2.4 Accessibility & Inclusiveness** 

One of Hospital Quick’s strongest pillars is its **uncompromising inclusiveness.** 

**USSD & SMS for Rural Access  (future development)** 

We have discovered that ussd is costly high to integrate it into the code because we need to pay for it realtime activation monthly 

● A special USSD code like \*131\# lets users this is example ussd however is not implemented yet which means after ativating this ussd feature we will e able to generate our own for this platform: 

● Book appointments 

● View upcoming visit details 

● email notifications are sent for: 

● Booking confirmation 

● Appointment reminders 

**Disability-Friendly User Interface** 

● Large font & high contrast mode for low vision users 

* Patient can describe his/her problem by just recording him/her speaking in less than 5 minutes .

**Conclusion: A Connected, Transparent Healthcare System** 

iTABAZA is more than just a software platform , it is a **healthcare revolution** built to meet the unique challenges of Rwanda’s growing population. By providing tools tailored to every role in the medical ecosystem and ensuring access for even the most vulnerable, it sets a new standard in African digital health innovation. 

In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into **technical and architectural design** , how this system was built, the tech stacks used, and how scalability, security, and data privacy were prioritized from day one.

 **KEY FUNCTIONALITIES** 

As Rwanda’s healthcare ecosystem advances, the need for **intelligent, inclusive, and responsive platforms** becomes more urgent. Hospital Quick was built from the ground up to address both the **day-to-day pains** and the **strategic gaps** in hospital workflows, patient experience, doctor collaboration, and public health governance. 

**III. Access to Digital Prescriptions and Lab Results** 

After consultation: 

● Patients receive digital prescriptions under his/her dashboard

● Lab test results are uploaded automatically once available 

● All documents are **stored  in supabase securely and can be downloaded anytime** 

**V. Book Video Call Consultations** 

Ideal for: 

● Patients in remote districts 

* Easy to recieve care in busy life condition

  **CHAPTER 4 : TECHNICAL DESIGN** 


  
To deliver more stable and reliable healthcare service across Rwanda, Hospital Quick is built on a modern, secure, and highly accessible digital infrastructure. In this chapter, we break down the technical design of the system in a way that is easy to understand, even for those without a background in software engineering . This ensures transparency and helps all doctors, and users like patient , grasp how the system works behind the scenes. 

**4.1 System Architecture** 

At its core, Hospital Quick connects patients, doctors, hospital staff, and government systems through several digital channels: 

● **Web App**: Patients can book appointments, join video consultations, receive prescriptions, and again patient can submit historical medical record before meeting doctor for doctor ro understand exact problem that patient is encountering . 

● **USSD (Short Code Dialing) “future development feature”**: For users without smartphones or internet access, USSD codes (e.g., \*123\#) allow interaction with the platform using basic phones. Patients can check doctor availability, book visits, and get notifications all offline. This is for future development

● **Backend APIs** : All our platforms is highly dependent on the APIs  mostly for connecting frontend with backend . backend is structured for orgising and calling data front-end or users enterfase and process the data to be correctly stored into the database (supabase “postSQLlite related database) ,  and making sure everything runs smoothly across ths iTABAZA web application . 

**4.2 Security & Compliance** 

● **Patient Privacy & Encrypted Communication**: All personal and medical data are stored securely and encrypted. This means only authorized users (such as a patient and their doctor) can view the information. This is correctly respected in database (supabase) for users to access certain information stored in data it must undergo authentication checkup to knw the privilege of person asking certain information.

● **Secure Access (OTP & Biometrics)**: To prevent unauthorized signup, the system uses *One-Time Passwords* (OTP) sent to the user's phone. On supported devices, fingerprint or facial recognition may also be used. This is for making sure that the users trying to sign up is using the email/cridentials available since they are used during appointment confirmation emailing . 

● **Role-Based Access Control**: Not everyone in the system sees the same thing. A patient can access their document as uploaded by doctor and appointments, while
