# How We Built the Patient Dashboard for iTABAZA Hospital

## What This Document Explains

This document tells the story of how we created the patient dashboard for the iTABAZA hospital system. We wanted to make it easy for patients to see their appointments, medical documents, and get help when they need it. Here's how we did it and what we learned along the way.

## The Problem We Started With

When we first started building iTABAZA, we had a basic system that let patients book appointments, but they couldn't really see what was happening with their healthcare. Patients would book an appointment and then have to call the hospital to check if it was confirmed or if anything changed. This was frustrating for everyone.

We also noticed that patients couldn't see their medical documents easily, and if they had problems with the system, there was no easy way to get help. We knew we needed to build something better.

## What We Built

### Step 1: Connecting to the Database

First, we connected our system to Supabase, which is like a powerful online database that can handle lots of data safely. This was actually easier than we thought because Supabase gives you a lot of tools to work with data.

We already had some tables working well - like the ones for users, doctors, appointments, and voice recordings. But we were missing some important pieces that patients really needed.

### Step 2: Creating the Missing Pieces

We realized we needed to create some new tables in our database. These tables would store:
- **Documents**: Medical files that doctors upload for patients
- **Support tickets**: When patients need help with the system
- **Login sessions**: To keep track of who's logged in

We wrote some SQL code (which is like instructions for the database) and put it in a file called `client-database-safe.sql`. When we ran this code in Supabase, it created all the missing tables we needed.

### Step 3: Building the Dashboard Features

Now we had to create the actual dashboard that patients would see. We built several different parts:

**Dashboard Overview**: This shows patients a quick summary of their healthcare - how many appointments they have, what's coming up next, and any important updates.

**Appointment Management**: Patients can see all their appointments in one place, with clear labels showing whether they're pending, confirmed, completed, or cancelled. We made it easy to understand with different colors for each status.

**Document Access**: When doctors upload medical documents (like prescriptions or lab results), patients can see them right in their dashboard and download them when they need to.

**Support System**: If patients have problems with the system or questions, they can create a "support ticket" right from their dashboard. This sends a message to the hospital staff who can help them.

### Step 4: Making It Work in Real Time

One of the coolest things we built was real-time updates. This means when something changes (like a doctor confirms an appointment), the patient's dashboard updates automatically without them having to refresh the page. This makes the system feel much more responsive and professional.

## How the Technical Parts Work

### The Backend (Server Side)

We created several new API endpoints (these are like web addresses that the dashboard can call to get information):

- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/{patientId}/dashboard` - Gets all the dashboard information for a patient
- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/{patientId}/appointments` - Gets all the patient's appointments
- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/{patientId}/documents` - Gets all the patient's medical documents
- `POST /api/dashboard/support/ticket` - Creates a new support ticket
- `GET /api/dashboard/support/tickets/{userId}` - Gets all support tickets for a user
- `PUT /api/dashboard/appointment/{appointmentId}/status` - Changes the status of an appointment

### The Frontend (What Patients See)

We wrote JavaScript code in a file called `patient-dashboard-new.js` that handles all the dashboard functionality:

- **Login and Security**: Makes sure only the right patient can see their information
- **Live Updates**: Refreshes the dashboard automatically when things change
- **Color-Coded Appointments**: Shows different colors for different appointment statuses
- **Document Display**: Shows medical documents in an easy-to-read format
- **Support Ticket Creation**: Lets patients easily create help requests
- **Error Handling**: Shows helpful messages when something goes wrong

## How Appointment Booking Works Now

When a patient books an appointment, here's what happens:

1. The patient fills out the booking form
2. The system saves the appointment in the database with status 'pending'
3. An email confirmation is automatically sent to the patient
4. The dashboard immediately shows the new appointment
5. Later, when a doctor reviews it, they can change the status to 'confirmed'
6. The dashboard updates in real-time to show the change

The appointment goes through these stages:
- **pending** → **confirmed** → **completed**
- Or it might go: **pending** → **cancelled**

## Testing What We Built

To make sure everything worked properly, we created some test commands:

- `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health` - This checks if our server is running properly
- We tested with real patient IDs to make sure the dashboard showed the right information
- We tested the appointment booking flow to make sure emails were sent and the dashboard updated

## Where All the Code Lives

The main files we created are:
- `patient-dashboard-new.html` - The main dashboard page that patients see
- `patient-dashboard-new.js` - All the JavaScript that makes the dashboard work
- `client-dashboard.html` - An alternative dashboard design

## What We Learned

Building this dashboard taught us several important lessons:

**User Experience Matters**: We realized that even small things like color-coding and real-time updates make a huge difference in how patients feel about using the system.

**Real-time Updates Are Powerful**: When patients see their information update automatically, it builds trust and makes the system feel more professional.

**Support Systems Are Essential**: Having an easy way for patients to get help when they need it prevents frustration and makes the whole system more user-friendly.

**Database Design Is Critical**: The way we organized our database tables made a big difference in how fast and reliable the dashboard works.

## The Login System

We also improved how patients log in:
- Patients log in at `/user/login`
- The system creates a secure token (like a digital key) and saves it
- Patient details are saved locally so the dashboard can access them
- Everything is encrypted and secure

## What's Already Working

We successfully created these database tables:
- **users**: All patient information
- **doctors**: Information about doctors
- **appointments**: All appointment bookings
- **departments**: Medical departments
- **voice_recordings**: Voice messages for appointments
- **admins**: Admin users

## What We Had to Create

We needed to build these new tables:
- **documents**: For storing medical files
- **support_tickets**: For help desk questions
- **doctor_sessions**: For tracking doctor logins
- **patient_sessions**: For tracking patient logins

## The Result

Today, patients using iTABAZA have a complete dashboard that shows them everything they need to know about their healthcare. They can see their appointments, access their medical documents, and get help when they need it. The system feels modern and professional, and most importantly, it actually makes healthcare easier to access.

This dashboard represents a big step forward in making healthcare more accessible and user-friendly in Rwanda. Instead of patients having to call hospitals or show up in person to check on their appointments, they can now see everything they need right from their phone or computer.
