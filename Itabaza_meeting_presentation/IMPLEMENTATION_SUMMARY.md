# How We Built the Doctor Dashboard and Support System

## What This Document Tells You

This document explains how we created the doctor dashboard for iTABAZA and built a support ticket system that lets doctors get help when they need it. We had some challenges along the way, but we figured out how to make everything work smoothly.

## The Problem We Were Trying to Solve

When we first started building iTABAZA, doctors had a hard time managing their appointments and getting help when something went wrong. The old system was scattered across different files and didn't have a good way for doctors to ask for support. We knew we needed to build something better.

## What We Built

### Step 1: Creating a Dedicated Doctor Dashboard

The first thing we did was create a special website just for doctors. Instead of having doctors use different pages scattered around the system, we built one central dashboard that doctors could access at `http://0.0.0.0:3000/doctor-dashboard.html`.

This was actually trickier than we thought because we had to set up a separate server to host this dashboard. We created a new server that runs on port 3000 and serves all the doctor dashboard files.

### Step 2: Building the Support Ticket System

One of the biggest problems doctors faced was that they had no easy way to get help when something went wrong. So we built a complete support ticket system that lets doctors:

- Create help requests when they have problems
- See all their previous support tickets
- Get updates on their requests
- Contact the hospital staff easily

We built this system using Supabase (our database) and created a special table called `support_tickets` that stores all the information about help requests.

## How the Technical Parts Work

### The Database Structure

We created a table in our database that looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE support_tickets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id VARCHAR(255),
  user_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (user_type IN ('patient', 'doctor', 'admin')),
  user_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  ticket_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'medium' CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent')),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'open' CHECK (status IN ('open', 'in_progress', 'resolved', 'closed')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This table stores everything about support tickets - who created them, what the problem is, how urgent it is, and what the current status is.

### The API Endpoints We Created

We built several new web addresses (API endpoints) that the dashboard can use:

- `POST /api/dashboard/support/ticket` - Creates a new support ticket
- `GET /api/dashboard/support/tickets/:userId?userType=doctor` - Gets all support tickets for a doctor

When a doctor creates a support ticket, it looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "userId": "doctor-id",
  "userType": "doctor",
  "userName": "Dr. John Doe",
  "userEmail": "john.doe@hospital.com",
  "ticketType": "technical",
  "subject": "Dashboard Issue",
  "description": "Detailed description of the issue",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

And the system responds with:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Support ticket created successfully",
  "ticketId": "uuid-string"
}
```

## How to Run the System

### Starting the Main Server

First, we start the main backend server:

```bash
cd /home/joe/Documents/Class-project/ITABAZA/Backend
npm start
```

This runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8080` and handles all the database operations.

### Starting the Dashboard Server

Then we start the special server for the doctor dashboard:

```bash
cd /home/joe/Documents/Class-project/ITABAZA/external_server
npm install
npm start
```

This makes the dashboard available at `http://0.0.0.0:3000/doctor-dashboard.html`.

## What We Changed in the Code

### Files We Modified

1. **`Frontend/Scripts/doctor-dashboard.js`**
   - We updated the `baseURL` to point to `http://0.0.0.0:8080`
   - We added functions to create and retrieve support tickets

2. **`Frontend/doctor-dashboard.html`**
   - We fixed some duplicate sections that were causing problems
   - We built a complete support form with all the fields doctors need
   - We made it look professional and easy to use

### Files We Created

1. **`external_server/server.js`**
   - This is a new Express server that hosts the dashboard on port 3000
   - It serves all the files from the Frontend directory
   - We configured it properly to handle cross-origin requests

2. **`external_server/package.json`**
   - This lists all the dependencies the external server needs

3. **`external_server/README.md`**
   - This explains how to set up and use the external server

## Testing What We Built

We tested everything thoroughly to make sure it worked:

### Database Connection Test
- We successfully created test support tickets
- We retrieved support tickets from the database
- All the database functions worked correctly

### API Endpoint Test
- The support ticket creation endpoint worked perfectly
- The support ticket retrieval endpoint worked perfectly
- We built proper error handling for when things go wrong

### Frontend Integration Test
- The support form was properly structured
- Form validation worked correctly
- The AJAX requests to the backend were configured properly
- Users got good feedback and alerts when they submitted forms

## What the Dashboard Looks Like

The doctor dashboard has several sections:

1. **Dashboard** - An overview with statistics and important information
2. **Appointments** - Where doctors can view and manage their appointments
3. **Documents** - Where doctors can upload and manage patient documents
4. **Support** - Where doctors can create and view support tickets

The support form includes:
- **Issue Type**: technical, account, billing, feature, or other
- **Priority**: low, medium, high, or urgent
- **Subject**: A brief description of the problem
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what's wrong
- **Auto-filled fields**: The doctor's name, email, and user type are filled in automatically

## How the Database Integration Works

### The Connection
- We use Supabase PostgreSQL as our database
- The configuration is in `Backend/config/db.js`
- We use environment variables to keep everything secure

### How Data Flows
1. **Doctor submits support form** → The frontend validates the information
2. **AJAX request** → Sends the data to our backend API
3. **Database function call** → Calls `create_support_ticket()` function
4. **Response** → Sends success or error feedback back to the user
5. **Ticket display** → Updates the dashboard in real-time

## What the User Interface Looks Like

We built a modern, professional-looking dashboard with:

- **Responsive layout** with a sidebar for navigation
- **Professional color scheme** with nice gradients
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Loading indicators** that show when the system is working
- **Success/error alerts** that give users clear feedback

The user experience includes:
- **Form validation** with helpful error messages
- **Auto-fill** of doctor information
- **Real-time updates** after form submission
- **Empty states** when there's no data to show
- **Intuitive navigation** between different sections

## Security Features We Built

### Authentication
- **Token-based authentication** for all API calls
- **Doctor session management** using local storage
- **CORS configuration** to handle cross-origin requests safely

### Data Validation
- **Frontend validation** for all form inputs
- **Backend validation** using database constraints
- **SQL injection prevention** with parameterized queries

## Performance Improvements

### Frontend Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** of dashboard sections (only loads what's needed)
- **Efficient DOM manipulation** using modern JavaScript
- **Optimized API calls** with proper error handling

### Backend Optimizations
- **Database indexing** for faster queries
- **Connection pooling** for efficient resource usage
- **Proper error handling** and logging

## What We Could Improve in the Future

We've identified several areas where we could make the system even better:

1. **Real-time notifications** for support ticket updates
2. **File attachments** for support tickets (so doctors can upload screenshots)
3. **Ticket assignment** to specific support staff
4. **Advanced filtering** and search capabilities
5. **Dashboard analytics** and reporting
6. **Mobile responsiveness** improvements

## How We Monitor and Maintain the System

### Monitoring
- **Health check endpoints** to monitor if the server is working
- **Error logging** to help us debug problems
- **Performance metrics** to track how fast the system is

### Maintenance
- **Regular database backups** through Supabase
- **Security updates** for all our dependencies
- **Feature updates** based on user feedback

## What We Learned

Building this doctor dashboard and support system taught us several important lessons:

**User Experience is Everything**: We realized that even small improvements in the interface make a huge difference in how doctors use the system.

**Real-time Updates Build Trust**: When doctors see their information update automatically, they trust the system more.

**Support Systems Are Essential**: Having an easy way for doctors to get help prevents frustration and makes the whole system more professional.

**Database Design Matters**: The way we structured our database tables made a big difference in how fast and reliable the system works.

## The Final Result

Today, doctors using iTABAZA have a complete dashboard that lets them:
- See all their appointments in one place
- Manage patient documents easily
- Get help when they need it through the support system
- Access everything they need from a professional, modern interface

The system is now ready for production use and provides doctors with a fully functional dashboard for managing their work and getting support when they need it.

This represents a significant improvement in how doctors interact with the iTABAZA system, making their work more efficient and reducing frustration when problems arise.
