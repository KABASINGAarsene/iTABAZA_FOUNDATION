# How We Fixed and Improved Doctor Visibility in iTABAZA

## What This Document Explains

This document tells the story of how we fixed several problems with how doctors were shown (or not shown) in the iTABAZA hospital system. We wanted to make sure that when a new doctor is added, they are immediately visible to patients, and that patients only see doctors who are actually available. Here's how we found the issues and what we did to fix them.

## The Problems We Found

When we first built the system, we noticed a few things were going wrong:

1. **API Endpoint Case Mismatch**: The frontend was calling `doctor/alldoctor` but the backend route was actually `doctor/allDoctor` (with a capital D). This meant the frontend couldn't get the list of doctors.
2. **Doctor Status Default Issue**: When new doctors were added, their status was set to `false` by default, so they were invisible to patients until an admin manually changed their status.
3. **No Filtering for Available Doctors**: There was no way to show only doctors who were approved and available. Patients could see doctors who weren't actually available for appointments.

## How We Fixed These Problems

### Step 1: Fixing the API Endpoint Case

We updated the frontend code in `Frontend/Scripts/doctor.js` to use the correct case for the API endpoint. Now it matches the backend and works correctly.

### Step 2: Making Doctors Available by Default

We changed the backend so that when a new doctor is added, their `status` is set to `true` by default. We also updated the database schema to make this the default value. Now, as soon as a doctor is added, they are visible to patients.

### Step 3: Adding Filtering for Available Doctors

We added new API endpoints to the backend:
- `GET /doctor/availableDoctors` - Returns only doctors who are approved and available
- `GET /doctor/availableDoctors/:departmentId` - Returns available doctors filtered by department

We also updated the frontend to use these new endpoints by default, so patients only see doctors they can actually book.

### Step 4: Improving the Doctor Model

We added new methods to the doctor model in the backend:
- `findAvailable()` - Gets only available doctors
- `findAvailableByDepartment(departmentId)` - Gets available doctors by department

### Step 5: Adding Sample Data and Testing Scripts

We created a script to add sample doctors with different specializations for testing. We also made a test script to verify that the new endpoints work correctly.

## What We Changed in the Code

### Backend Changes
- Updated `doctor.router.js` to set `status: true` by default and add new endpoints
- Updated `doctor.model.js` to add new filtering methods
- Updated `supabase-schema.sql` to set `status BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE`
- Added `add-sample-doctors.js` to create sample doctors
- Added `test-doctors.js` to test the new endpoints

### Frontend Changes
- Fixed API endpoint case in `doctor.js`
- Updated to use `/availableDoctors` by default
- Updated department filtering to use available doctors
- Updated `video-appointment.js` and `in-person-appointment.js` to use the new endpoints
- Added `DOCTOR_AVAILABLE` endpoint configuration in `baseURL.js`

## How We Tested the Fixes

1. **Run Sample Data Script**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   node add-sample-doctors.js
   ```
2. **Test Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   node test-doctors.js
   ```
3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Start the backend server: `npm start`
   - Open the frontend in a browser
   - Go to the doctors page and verify doctors are visible
   - Test department filtering and search functionality

## What Changed for Users

### Before the Fixes
- Doctors were not visible due to API endpoint mismatch
- New doctors were invisible until an admin changed their status
- Patients could see doctors who weren't actually available

### After the Fixes
- Doctors are immediately visible when added by an admin
- Only approved and available doctors are shown to patients
- Department filtering works correctly
- Patients have a better experience and only see doctors they can actually book

## Database Migration for Existing Data

If you already had doctors in the system, we provided a script to update their status:

```sql
-- Update existing doctors to be available
UPDATE doctors SET status = true, is_available = true WHERE status = false;
```

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/doctor/allDoctor` | GET | Get all doctors (admin use) |
| `/doctor/availableDoctors` | GET | Get only available doctors (patient use) |
| `/doctor/availableDoctors/:id` | GET | Get available doctors by department |
| `/doctor/allDoctor/:id` | GET | Get all doctors by department (admin use) |
| `/doctor/addDoctor` | POST | Add new doctor (instantly available) |
| `/doctor/updateDoctorStatus/:id` | PATCH | Update doctor approval status |
| `/doctor/isAvailable/:doctorId` | PATCH | Update doctor availability |

## Why These Fixes Matter

- **Instant Availability**: Doctors are available for booking as soon as they're added
- **Better Performance**: Backend filtering means the frontend doesn't have to do extra work
- **Improved User Experience**: Patients only see doctors they can actually book
- **Consistent API**: Endpoints are named and structured properly
- **Scalable**: It's easy to add more filtering options in the future

## What We Learned

Fixing these issues taught us that small details like API endpoint names and default values can have a big impact on how the system works for users. By making these changes, we made the system more reliable, user-friendly, and ready to scale as we add more features in the future.
